🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the price of a used car based on various features like year, fuel type, transmission, kilometers driven, and engine specifications. The goal is to help buyers and sellers estimate a fair market price for used cars.

🧠 Tech Stack
Python
Pandas & NumPy for data processing
Scikit-learn for model building
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
Linear Regression (can be upgraded to RandomForest/XGBoost)
📁 Dataset Features
name (car model)
year (manufacture year)
km_driven (kilometers driven)
fuel (Petrol/Diesel/CNG/LPG/Electric)
transmission (Manual/Automatic)
owner (first/second owner, etc.)
mileage, engine, max_power, seats
price (target variable)
📈 Workflow
Data cleaning & preprocessing
Encoding categorical features
Train-test split
Model training using Linear Regression
Model evaluation (R² score)
Predicting price for new input data
💡 Future Improvements
Replace Linear Regression with RandomForest or XGBoost
Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
Add interactive data visualization
Connect to a live car listing API for real-time price comparisons
